## Configure client
To connect to your server, you need a custom client. Here the only solution is to use a [pre-made client](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tjjhv2dzmh2542f/BS-Client.apk?dl=0). Just replace the IP in the frida-gadget config with yours (```/lib/armeabi-v7a/libgg.config.so```) ```{"interaction":{"interaction":{"type":"script","path":"libscript.so","on_change":"reload","parameters":{"redirectHost":"YOUR_IP","relocate":true}}}```
