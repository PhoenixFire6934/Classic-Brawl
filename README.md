## Prerequisites

- python 3.7




## Run Server
- On Windows:
    - Download Python 3.7 or newer version from official page.
    - Download the server and extract it.
    - Execute "main.py" file
- On Linux:
    - Open Terminal and install Python by executing following command:
    ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip```
    - Download the server and extract it.
    - Execute "main.py" file
- On Android:
    - Download and install PyDroid app from Google Play.
    - Open PyDroid and wait until Python installs.
    - Download the server and extract it.
    - In PyDroid open and execute "main.py" file


## Configure client
To connect to your server, you need a custom client. Here the only solution is to use a [pre-made client](https://mega.nz/file/vSIDFKaT#pDdGFkevXwp_3LP1wW1wtj23Gj2aADZwzfXAAI8JEs8). Just replace the IP in the frida-gadget config with yours (```/lib/armeabi-v7a/libgg.config.so```) ```{"interaction":{"interaction":{"type":"script","path":"libscript.so","on_change":"reload","parameters":{"redirectHost":"YOUR_IP","relocate":true}}}```
